Using C++ I made a encryption/decryption tool that uses a custom algorithm that I made up. It is based around salting strings and encoding them using base64 mehtods.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you are getting an error while decrypting an input file please remove any extra new lines that the input file has, this crashes my program. I am working on fixing this!
